                        <strong>Dear Prince,</strong>
                        <p>
                             Loving you is easy,it comes with the winds<br>
                             wraps me with a blanket,soft and warm to the touch<br>
                             Without realising I've made a home out of you,<br>
                            musky cologne and big doe eyes<br>
                             wavy hair and soft hands to hold,all mine<br>
                             I love you without knowing how ,or when or from where<br>
                             maybe when we walked through the roads of Banaras<br>
                             or when you'll shyly smile on seeing me everytime<br>
                             I love you like this because I don't know any other way to love,<br>
                             and to keep loving you whichever way you want to be loved<br>
                             I'll learn to weave you grass rings,<br>
                             for all ten of your fingers<br>
                            you can tuck a flower behind my ear somedays<br>
                            we can watch entire seasons of all your favourite sitcoms on the holidays,<br>
                            on the rare times that i write,<br>
                            i wish my words,to be for your eyes<br>
                            i might write about the silence we share<br>
                            and the silly moments when you laugh at my jokes<br>
                            i might write about how i haven't seen the moon since yesterday<br>
                            and how i sometimes see it in mirror selfies of a certain office<br>
                            i will write as you be,<br>
                            because loving you is easy.<br>
                            Happy birthday my love
